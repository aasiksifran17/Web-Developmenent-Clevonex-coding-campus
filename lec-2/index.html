        <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> is simply <b>dummy</b> text of the <strong>printing</strong> and typesetting industry.
        <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> has been the <del>industry's</del> standard <ins>dummy</ins> text ever since the
        1500s, when an
        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially <mark>unchanged</mark>.
